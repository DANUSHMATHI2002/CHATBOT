# Medics-Chatbot
### ✅ Objective

Healthcare chatbots will continue to exist. The potential for chatbots in healthcare is far greater than what we now observe.

### ✅ Project Context

Answering medical questions, gathering patient information, and other things are some of their other applications. Additionally, given the quick development of NLP, it is certain that future healthcare chatbots would handle considerably more complex use cases.

### ✅ Model Architecture

* Fixed Rule-based: Pre-existing chatbots are created using simple machine learning algorithms, a predetermined set of rules, and template-based matching .
* Grammatical Errors: Grammar errors are undetected. The majority of chatbots only respond to queries from a limited domain or those that have been predefined in the database, according to prior studies. 
* Ambiguity: When a sentence's context or meaning are unclear or serve no useful function. 
* Language structure: Different languages have different rules for structuring sentences. Each language, for instance, has its own norms for punctuation, text organisation, and space usage. While chatbots in use today cannot tell the difference. 

### ✅ Dependencies

* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* Wordpress
* Tidio
* Profreehost

### ✅ Project Stage

### ✅ Project Outcome

Patients and medical professionals can both get medical information through chatbots. According to user input, a chatbot may be designed to respond to frequently asked queries about symptoms and treatments and even make rough medical diagnosis. This can lessen the amount of time that patients must wait in crowded clinics or hospitals and the number of phone calls that patients' physicians must return.
